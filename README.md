# SimpleClockApp
Simple web based clock built for my school to use during exams. Time can be projected onto a surface large enough for an entire hall to see. Includes two clock types (12hour and 24hour). Clock can be displayed on its own, or in a split screen format with exam information (Name, Times etc) to the side. See screenshots below.

**Installation**
Copy files to a PHP capable web server. Simple as that.
